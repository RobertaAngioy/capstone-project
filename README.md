This project is an Analysis of the superstore to help the company to find out the most effective way to spend money on advertising media to improve sales for the next year with a less advertising budget.

Companies spend a lot of money on different advertising media to increase the sales of their products.

Predicting the future demand for any product and stocking them is essential in every business organisation. With a precise prediction, one can achieve better customer retention and satisfaction and avoid over-stock or under-stock situations. Accurate forecasts of future sales assist the firm in developing a business plan or strategy based on market demand and present conditions. Standard sales forecasting helps firms review historical scenarios and implement customer purchase inferences. Evaluate shortcomings and weaknesses before budgeting and establishing a solid plan for the following year. A thorough understanding of previous opportunities enables one to plan for future market demands and increase one's likelihood of succeeding. Regardless of external factors, firms that view sales modelling as the first step toward improved performance outperform those that do not.

This work aims to:  
Analyse the past sales of the products and the relationship between Sales and Profit, understanding the factors that affect a product's sales and which category is the best seller.
Deriving inferences related to those sales, predicting the future sales from the inferences derived , and help the businesses stock up/stock down products accordingly.

Analysing the sales grouped by State, we can see the total sales for each State Unsurprisingly, most of the sales come from heavily populated states like California, New York, and Texas; these states also have the most profit.

We can gather from these pie charts that the highest percentages of both sales and profit come from the west. the west accounts for 31.6% of sales and 37.9% of profits. It's interesting that just 2 of the top 15 states are Western States.

Binders and Paper are the Top 2 best-selling sub-categories.
Copiers produce the most profit, followed by Phones, Accessories, Papers and Binders. The marketing strategy has to focus on marketing these products.
On the other end of the spectrum, Machines, Fasteners, Supplies, Bookcases and Tables make close to zero
margins to losses. These are products that Super Store can consider dropping from the product catalogue or increasing the sale.

So far, the heavily populated states are the main drivers of sales and profit. Binders, Paper and Phones are the more significant product sales drivers than the other product categories.
And 60.3% of products belong to Office Supplies, 21.2% of products belong to Furniture, and only 18.5% of products belong to Technology.

Technology is Best Selling, and it's good to know that this category is the Most Profitable too. Only a minimal quantity is sold as these products are usually one-off purchases that can last at least 4â€“5 years. Although Furniture makes similar sales as Technology, it is the least profitable, and the quantity sold is at a minimum too.

For the order date, The highest sales were in November 2017. The lowest was in February 2014. But generally speaking, for all years, there is a dip in February and a peak around October or November
It can probably be explained by seasonal demand - before Christmas (from November to the end of December).
For the ship date, the same conditions occur, i.e. there is a drop in February for all years, and there is a peak around November.

In conclusion, I can point out some insights and conclusions from this analysis.
Some of the states that had higher sales had net negative profits overall. Across the board, Technology profits seemed to be doing better than Office Supplies and Furniture.
In the highest-profit states, phones, binders, and storage were very popular.
Despite some of the states with higher sales netting negative profits, eastern and western states collectively were the two best regions driving profits.
Some sub-categories, namely machines, tables, and bookcases, were the main drivers of profit loss, as almost all records of these products netted negative profits.
Furnishings and appliances were netting negative profits in the eastern states.
After performing Principal Component Analysis, it's possible to see what products drove higher sales: Technology products drove positive profits (namely copiers), while some furniture and office supplies products were dragging profits down. These records of negative yields also had higher discounts.
